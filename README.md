## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

-   Basic Git and Github commands and workflow.
-   Use CSS full modern reset
-   Don't use rem-font-hack ({html {font-size: 62.5%;}}). It can cause accessibility issues for users and development issues. Details in the [Article on rem-font-hack] in [](#useful-resources) below

### Continued development

-   Improve skills related to measurements and spacing
-   Learn more Git and Github when needed
